# terraformmonitoring


Blue Print - In Progress...  

Stateless Microservices Services - Monitor using Jaeger distributed tracing
Instrument the microservices with dynamic tracing and span on/off

UI, API, Batch, Search, Adapters

Stateful Services - Monitor using Prometheus, Grafana

Redis, Kafka, Elastic Search, Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL,....

End to End monitoring using Apache Flink streaming SQL engine 

This should work with cloud native, on prem anthos, and more. 
Do we need anything else?
